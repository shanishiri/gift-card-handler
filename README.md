# gift-card-handler

You have been given a gift card that is about to expire and you want to buy gifts for 2 friends.
You want to spend the whole gift card, or if thatâ€™s not an option as close to the balance as
possible. You have a list of sorted prices for a popular store that you know they both like to shop
at. Your challenge is to find two distinct items in the list whose sum is minimally under (or equal
to) the gift card balance.

The file contains two columns:
1. A unique identifier of the item. You can assume there are no duplicates.
2. The value of that item in cents. It is always a positive integer that represents the price in cents
(1000 = $10.00).

Running the program and give it command argument:
$ cat prices.txt
Candy Bar, 500
Paperback Book, 700
Detergent, 1000
Headphones, 1400
Earmuffs, 2000
Bluetooth Stereo, 6000

$ find-pair prices.txt 2500
Candy Bar 500, Earmuffs 2000

$ find-pair prices.txt 1100
